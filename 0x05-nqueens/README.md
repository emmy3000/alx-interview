# 0x05. N Queens

## Introduction
The N Queens problem is a classic puzzle where you need to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This project provides a Python script to find solutions to the N-Queens problem for a given chessboard size.

## Features

-**`nqueens.py`**: This script allows you to find solutions to the N-Queens problem.
- **Input Validation**: The script validates user input to ensure that the chessboard size is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4.
- **Documentation**: The code is well-documented with docstrings and code comments for clarity and understanding.
- **Usage**: The script is easy to use and provides solutions to the N-Queens problem.

## Usage

- Clone this repository to your local machine.

- Navigate to the project directory:

```shell
cd 0x05-nqueens
```
- Run the script with the desired chessboard size (N) as an argument:

```shell
./0-nqueens.py N
```
Replace N with the size of the chessboard you want (e.g., 8 for an 8x8 chessboard).

- The script will print the solutions to the N-Queens problem for the given chessboard size.

## Examples
```shell
./0-nqueens.py 8
```

## Requirements
Python 3.x
